      Cats are semi-lazy but typically energetic creatures. But, have you ever
      realized why when cats get an energy burst, they seem neurotic? 
      Cats have a tenancy to go into play-mode, which can be signified with
      wide eyes and almost abnormally rapid movement.

    <p>
      When a cat has wide eyes and large, dilated pupils, they're usually looking
      for something to entertain them, or some form of play. Cats have the potiental
      to be very energetic and spastic creatures, and encouraging them to engage
      in activity helps them be healthy by burning off excess energy and fat. <br> <br> So, next time
      if your cat has wide eyes and rapid tail movement, try fetching your cat's
      favorite toy, both of you will benefit.
